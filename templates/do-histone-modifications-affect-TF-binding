<h2>Do histone modifications affect TF binding?</h2>
<p>
The goal of this discussion is to gather and discuss the evidence (if any)
that histone modifications can directly affect transcription factor (TFs)
binding <em>in vivo</em>. Please note that the discussion is about histone
modifications and not about chromatin remodelling in general.
